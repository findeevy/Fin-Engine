Finengine is a simple, open-source 3D render made with C++ and Vulkan. I'm currently working on it to learn more about GPU programming and 3D rendering while I read "Real Time Rendering".

Dependencies:
Vulkan SDK - https://vulkan.lunarg.com/
GLFW - https://www.glfw.org/
GLM - https://github.com/g-truc/glm
